# markdown.new

Use markdown.new to turn public URLs or files into Markdown, crawl a site section into one Markdown document, or use the hosted editor utilities.

The bundled behavior notes are a snapshot verified on April 9, 2026 with direct `curl` requests, browser automation, and failure-case probes, not permanent service guarantees.

When a route fails, documentation conflicts, or a consequential detail is missing, consult current official markdown.new/Cloudflare documentation and use a bounded public or synthetic probe if authorized. Do not upload private files or credentials merely to diagnose drift. State unresolved limits when live evidence is unavailable. Propose a canonical skill correction with the old claim, source/date, and sanitized response or reproducer; do not silently edit installed copies or publish it.

## Decision Tree

What are you trying to do?

- Convert one public page or API response into Markdown
  - Read `references/url-conversion.md`

- Convert a remote file URL or upload a local file
  - Read `references/file-conversion.md`

- Crawl multiple same-site pages and fetch one combined Markdown result
  - Read `references/crawl.md`

- Use the hosted UI pages or the live editor
  - Read `references/editor.md`

- Debug odd behavior, rate limits, query-string edge cases, or bad responses
  - Read `references/gotchas.md`

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command or Route | Read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Convert one page to Markdown | `curl -s 'https://markdown.new/https://example.com'` | `references/url-conversion.md` |
| Convert one page to JSON | `curl -s 'https://markdown.new/https://example.com?format=json'` | `references/url-conversion.md` |
| Force browser rendering | `curl -s -X POST 'https://markdown.new/' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"url":"https://example.com","method":"browser"}'` | `references/url-conversion.md` |
| Convert a remote file URL | `curl -s 'https://markdown.new/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/README.md?format=json'` | `references/file-conversion.md` |
| Upload a local file | `curl -s -X POST 'https://markdown.new/convert' -F 'file=@notes.pdf'` | `references/file-conversion.md` |
| Start a crawl job | `curl -s -X POST 'https://markdown.new/crawl' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"url":"https://docs.example.com","limit":50}'` | `references/crawl.md` |
| Poll crawl status as JSON | `curl -s 'https://markdown.new/crawl/status/<jobId>?format=json'` | `references/crawl.md` |
| Open the hosted editor | `https://markdown.new/markdown-editor` | `references/editor.md` |

## Reading Guide

| If the user says... | Read |
| --- | --- |
| "Use markdown.new on this URL" | `references/url-conversion.md` |
| "Turn this PDF / CSV / raw file URL into Markdown" | `references/file-conversion.md` |
| "Crawl this docs section into one Markdown export" | `references/crawl.md` |
| "What does the markdown.new UI/editor support?" | `references/editor.md` |
| "Why did markdown.new return junk / 500 / no tokens?" | `references/gotchas.md` |

## Verified Behaviors

1. Bare domains are normalized. `https://markdown.new/example.com?format=json` resolved to `https://example.com` in testing.
2. `GET /<url>` defaults to `text/markdown`, while `GET /<url>?format=json` and `POST /` return JSON.
3. `retain_images=true` changes output. Browser-mode conversion of `https://www.python.org/` produced Markdown image syntax only when `retain_images` was true.
4. GitHub raw file URLs work well. GitHub `blob` URLs returned HTML-heavy noise in testing.
5. Crawl jobs are cached. Re-running a crawl on `https://example.com` returned a cached job created on April 3, 2026.

## Gotchas

1. **Use POST for complex target URLs**: URLs with their own query strings were reliable with `POST /` but a fully percent-encoded GET path returned HTTP 400 in testing.
2. **Do not trust `method` as provenance**: the service documents a native Markdown-first pipeline, but a known Markdown endpoint still reported `Cloudflare Workers AI` in a live test.
3. **Expect weak error reporting**: missing `url`, malformed JSON, bogus crawl IDs, and invalid paths returned 400/500 without a useful error body in testing.
4. **Do not assume `tokens` always exists**: browser-mode responses omitted `tokens` in testing even when the conversion succeeded.
5. **Crawl limits are documented inconsistently**: the homepage says 100 pages in one section, while the crawl page says 500 pages and accepts `limit` values up to 500.

## Helper Script

Use `scripts/probe_markdown_new.py` when you want a structured probe instead of hand-writing `curl` commands. It wraps the main GET, POST, crawl, status, and upload flows and prints JSON with the HTTP status, selected headers, and parsed body.
